            <h1>Hi, I'm Curtis!</h1>
            <p>
            I am a problem solver with a passion for computer science. 
            I am an upcoming junior majoring in computer science at UCLA. 
            I love keeping up to date on industry trends and last but not least,
            I enjoy playing basketball and drawing in my free time. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My technical expertise includes proficiency in Python and C/C++. I also have experience 
            with web development technologies such as React.js, Firebase, HTML, and CSS. I am currently 
            looking for internship opportunities. Aside from looking for internships, I am also a private tutor. 
            </p>
